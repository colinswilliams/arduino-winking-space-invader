# Winking space invader, go.

So I took this rad Arduino workshop at [The Good Mod](http://thegoodmod.com), and now I'm adding my favorite sketch from that session.

Using [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com)'s [8x8 LED Matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1854), I created a space invader. And then I was like "what would be cooler than a space invader? A space invader that winks." But then I was like "you know what would be even cooler? Is if it only winked on button push." So I made that.

And here's the code.

To run, it depends on their [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library).

I'll post the wiring schematic sometime. Soon, hopefully, but I'll probably forget and not do it soon.
